For those of us working in Unity:
Please compress (rar/zip) your project folders before committing to Git. DO NOT upload the project folder as is. 
It causes problems sometimes. I would suggest having your working project in a seperate folder than your local Git repo. 
When you want to commit, save all your work, close unity, compress the prpject folder, copy it to the Git repo, commit
with proper log message. After commit, you may delete the first compressed folder to save disk space.
